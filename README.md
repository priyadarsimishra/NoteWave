# NoteWave  

## Inspiration  
We were inspired by the potential to make learning more accessible and engaging for students and professionals alike. Podcasts simplify complex topics while fitting seamlessly into busy schedules. With this idea, we envisioned NoteWave: a tool that transforms traditional study materials into an audio-first experience, making learning not just informative but also convenient.

## What it Does  
NoteWave converts PDF-based class notes, lecture materials, or documents into high-quality, context-aware podcasts. Users can upload their files, and the platform:  
1. **Summarizes** the document using **Google Pegasus**, ensuring key points are retained.  
2. **Generates a script** with **Llama**, tailored for engaging and natural delivery.  
3. Converts the script to **natural-sounding audio** with **Amazon Polly**.  

The result is a complete audio experience, accompanied by a live transcript with synchronized highlighting for easy navigation and accessibility.

## How We Built It  
- **Frontend**: Built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, delivering a clean and user-friendly interface.  
- **Backend**: Powered by **AI-based NLP models** to parse and summarize content, ensuring clarity and coherence in the generated scripts.  
- **PDF Parsing**: Custom algorithms handle varied formatting, extracting meaningful content for further processing.  
- **Text-to-Speech**: Leveraged **Amazon Polly** for high-quality, lifelike audio narration.  
- **Cloud Services**: Utilized **AWS** for secure file storage, processing, and scalability.  

## Challenges We Faced  
1. **AI-Generated Audio**: Ensuring natural flow, proper emphasis, and avoiding monotony in generated audio required significant fine-tuning of both the script and text-to-speech models.  
2. **PDF Parsing**: Handling the wide variety of PDF formats and extracting meaningful content posed technical challenges.  
3. **UX/UI Balance**: Balancing rich functionality with an intuitive, clean design to enhance usability was a continuous challenge.  

## Accomplishments We’re Proud Of  
- Successfully integrating **live transcript synchronization** with audio playback, making content more accessible for users.  
- Creating a seamless workflow where users can transform study materials into podcasts in just a few clicks.  
- Delivering high-quality AI-generated scripts that retain both the essence and readability of the source material.  

## What We Learned  
- The importance of **optimizing AI** models for real-world, unstructured inputs like PDFs to achieve consistent results.  
- How to **combine cutting-edge NLP models** with user-focused design to create a tool that balances technical complexity and simplicity.  
- Managing **cross-platform integrations**, such as cloud storage and AI services, to provide a cohesive user experience.  

## What’s Next for NoteWave  
1. **Multi-Language Support**: Expanding capabilities to support various languages, making the platform accessible to a global audience.  
2. **Voice Customization**: Allowing users to personalize the audio narration style, tone, and pitch.  
3. **Concise Summaries**: Enhancing AI summarization to provide shorter, more digestible audio snippets.  
4. **Mobile Application**: Developing a mobile app for easy access on the go.  
5. **Integrations**: Adding support for platforms like Google Drive and Dropbox to streamline workflows.
